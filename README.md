# Simple Auto Update

This was a re-implementation of `unattend-upgrade` at a time, where I actually did not know, that the latter one exists.

I created it as a student project on my public school to automate mass update Raspian installations on a Pi - not a cake, but a single-board computer (SBC) with a raspberries included ;) .
I created it also, since I was lazy fool on the hill, you probably know me from the Beatles song with the same name.

Note:

* Code from 2015 to 2017
* Git used since 2017, I already told you, I was a fool
* Limited knowledge in bash during coding
* Not my current state of knowledge, but published for entertaining purposes

**Warnung**: Not production ready, it was used in production, but that does not mean anything relevant.
Use at your own risk or better not.
